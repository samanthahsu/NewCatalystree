How do you implement instance ID? https://developers.google.com/instance-id/#identify-and-track-apps (still doesnt know)
Best practices for unique identifiers (user ID syncing): https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids#java

5/19/2018 Installed Firebase (updated "build.gradle (Module: app)", "build.gradle (Project: New Catalystree)", "AndroidManifest.xml", copy "google-services.json" into the "app" folder in "project" mode (not post it here because it exposes the API or something (hence git guardian))). Also firebase testing and tutorial "https://youtu.be/vJ7bfAPt4hY".
